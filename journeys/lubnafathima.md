# My Journey 👣
### ☞ Smart India Hackathon 2020
📌 Even though I enrolled in engineering college, I had no idea what coding was until the end of my first semester.  

📌 I participated in Smart India Hackathon 2020 with my team of mostly girls from a science background.  

📌 The competition was initially overwhelming since we were freshmen competing against senior students.  

📌 As a result of our in-depth preparation and commitment to the competition, we became the competition's finalists.  

### ☞ #100DaysOfCode Challenge

📌 Even though the website we built for the competition wasn't very appealing, I wanted to learn more about it.  

📌 It was amazing how much you could learn from free resources on YouTube.  

📌 However, I wasn't consistent with my learning, and I discovered Twitter's #100DaysOfCode challenge, which increased my learning 10X and productivity.  

📌 Thanks to the amazing Twitter Tech community who encouraged and helped me in my public learning.  

📌 As a result, I have learned various technologies, created many projects, and received many interview offers.  

### ☞ Other Learnings :

📌 YouTube and the tech community introduced me to data structure algorithms and the importance of contributing to open source, which I wish I had known years ago.  

📌 Compared to my college professors, [Kunal kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ) explained a lot better in his playlist.  

📌 Then shoutout to [Eddie Jaoude](https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude) for inspiring people like me to start open source contribution.  

📌 I'm very thankful for the way my life turned out.

📌 If I could do so much, so can anyone reading this.  

📌 Keep learning and Inspiring people around you.  

📌 Help your community in the same way you were helped once by it.
